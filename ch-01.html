<p>
We are about to study the idea of a
<i>computational process</i>. Computational processes
are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes
manipulate other abstract things called <i>data</i>. The
evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a
<i>program</i>. People create programs to direct processes. In
effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
</p>

<p>
A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a
spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at
all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can
answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank
or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to
conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully
composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric
<i>programming languages</i> that prescribe the tasks we want our
processes to perform.
</p>

<p>
A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes
programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice,
novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the
consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called
<i>glitches</i>) in programs can have
complex and unanticipated consequences.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than
learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently
contained in a secure way. Real-world programming, however, requires
care, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design
program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an
airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.
</p>

<p>
Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that
they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform
the tasks intended. They can visualize the behavior of their systems in
advance. They know how to structure programs so that unanticipated
problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and when problems do
arise, they can <i>debug</i> their programs. Well-designed
computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear
reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be
constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

<li><a id="org7d6151a"></a><b>Programming in Lisp</b><br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-0-0-1">
<p>
We need an appropriate language for describing processes, and we will
use for this purpose the programming language Lisp. Just as our everyday
thoughts are usually expressed in our natural language (such as English,
French, or Japanese), and descriptions of quantitative phenomena are
expressed with mathematical notations, our procedural thoughts will be
expressed in Lisp. Lisp was invented in the late 1950s as a
formalism for reasoning about the use of certain kinds of logical
expressions, called <i>recursion equations</i>, as a model for
computation. The language was conceived by John McCarthy and
is based on his paper ``Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and
Their Computation by Machine'' (McCarthy 1960).
</p>

<p>
Despite its inception as a mathematical formalism, Lisp is a practical
programming language. A Lisp <i>interpreter</i> is a machine that
carries out processes described in the Lisp language. The first Lisp
interpreter was implemented by McCarthy with the help of
colleagues and students in the Artificial Intelligence Group of the
MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics and in the MIT
Computation Center.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> Lisp, whose
name is an acronym for LISt Processing, was designed to provide
symbol-manipulating capabilities for attacking programming problems such
as the symbolic differentiation and integration of algebraic
expressions. It included for this purpose new data objects known as
atoms and lists, which most strikingly set it apart from all other
languages of the period.
</p>

<p>
Lisp was not the product of a concerted design effort. Instead, it
evolved informally in an experimental manner in response to users' needs
and to pragmatic implementation considerations. Lisp's informal
evolution has continued through the years, and the community of Lisp
users has traditionally resisted attempts to promulgate any ``official''
definition of the language. This evolution, together with the
flexibility and elegance of the initial conception, has enabled Lisp,
which is the second oldest language in widespread use today (only
Fortran is older), to continually adapt to encompass the
most modern ideas about program design. Thus, Lisp is by now a family of
dialects, which, while sharing most of the original features, may differ
from one another in significant ways. The dialect of Lisp used in this
book is called Scheme.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Because of its experimental character and its emphasis on symbol
manipulation, Lisp was at first
very inefficient for numerical computations, at least in comparison with
Fortran. Over the years, however, Lisp compilers have been developed
that translate programs into machine code that can perform numerical
computations reasonably efficiently. And for special applications, Lisp
has been used with great effectiveness.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>
Although Lisp has not yet overcome its old reputation as hopelessly
inefficient, Lisp is now used in many applications where efficiency is
not the central concern. For example, Lisp has become a language of
choice for operating-system shell languages and for extension languages
for editors and computer-aided design systems.
</p>

<p>
If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the
framework for our discussion of programming? Because the language
possesses unique features that make it an excellent medium
for studying important programming constructs and data structures and
for relating them to the linguistic features that support them. The most
significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of
processes, called <i>procedures</i>, can themselves
be represented and manipulated as Lisp data. The importance of this is
that there are powerful program-design techniques that rely on the
ability to blur the traditional distinction between ``passive'' data and
``active'' processes. As we shall discover, Lisp's flexibility in
handling procedures as data makes it one of the most convenient
languages in existence for exploring these techniques. The ability to
represent procedures as data also makes Lisp an excellent language for
writing programs that must manipulate other programs as data, such as
the interpreters and compilers that support computer languages. Above
and beyond these considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.

<h3 id="orgbb3b97e"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> The Elements of Programming</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
A powerful programming language is more than just a means
for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as
a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus,
when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the
means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more
complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for
accomplishing this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>primitive expressions</b>, which represent the simplest entities the
language is concerned with,</li>

<li><b>means of combination</b>, by which compound elements are built from
simpler ones, and</li>

<li><b>means of abstraction</b>, by which compound elements can be named and
manipulated as units.</li>
</ul>


<p>
In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements:
data. (Later we will discover
that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is ``stuff''
that we want to manipulate, and procedures are descriptions of the rules
for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language
should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and
should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter we will deal only with simple
numerical data so that we can focus on the
rules for building procedures.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> In later
chapters we will see that these same rules allow us to build procedures
to manipulate compound data as well.
</p>
</div>



<div id="outline-container-org9ee13be" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9ee13be"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.1</span> Expressions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical
interactions with an interpreter for the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Imagine
that you are sitting at a computer terminal. You type an <i>expression</i>,
and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its
<i>evaluating</i> that expression.
</p>

<p>
One kind of primitive expression you might
type is a number. (More precisely, the expression that you type consists
of the numerals that represent the number in base 10.) If you present
Lisp with a number
</p>

<p>
<code>486</code>
</p>

<p>
the interpreter will respond by printing<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<code>486</code>
</p>

<p>
Expressions representing numbers may be
combined with an expression representing a
primitive
procedure (such as <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>) to form a compound expression that
represents the application of the procedure to those numbers. For
example:
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ 137 349) 486 (- 1000 334) 666 (* 5 99) 495 (/ 10 5) 2 (+ 2.7 10) 12.7</code>
</p>

<p>
Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of
expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure
application, are called <i>combinations</i>. The leftmost element in the list
is called the <i>operator</i>, and the other elements are called
value of a combination is
obtained by applying the procedure specified by the operator to the
<i>arguments</i> that are the values of the operands.
</p>

<p>
The convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands is
known as <i>prefix notation</i>, and it may be somewhat
confusing at first because it departs significantly from the customary
mathematical convention. Prefix notation has several advantages,
however. One of them is that it can accommodate
procedures that may take an arbitrary number
of arguments, as in the following examples:
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ 21 35 12 7) 75  (* 25 4 12) 1200</code>
</p>

<p>
No ambiguity can arise, because the operator is always the leftmost
element and the entire combination is delimited by the parentheses.
</p>

<p>
A second advantage of prefix notation is that it extends in
a straightforward way to allow combinations to be <i>nested</i>, that is, to
have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations:
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6)) 19</code>
</p>

<p>
There is no limit (in principle) to the depth of such nesting and to the
overall complexity of the expressions that the Lisp interpreter can
evaluate. It is we humans who get confused by still relatively simple
expressions such as
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ (* 3 (+ (* 2 4) (+ 3 5))) (+ (- 10 7) 6))</code>
</p>

<p>
which the interpreter would readily evaluate to be 57. We can help
ourselves by writing such an expression in the form
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ (* 3       (+ (* 2 4)          (+ 3 5)))    (+ (- 10 7)       6))</code>
</p>

<p>
following a formatting convention known as
<i>pretty-printing</i>, in which each long combination is
written so that the operands are aligned vertically. The resulting
indentations display clearly the structure of the
expression.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Even with complex expressions, the interpreter always operates in the
same basic cycle: It reads an expression from the terminal, evaluates
the expression, and prints the result. This mode of operation is often
expressed by saying that the interpreter runs in a
<i>read-eval-print loop</i>. Observe in particular
that it is not necessary to explicitly instruct the interpreter to print
the value of the expression.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org60c6bbf" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org60c6bbf"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.2</span> Naming and the Environment</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for
using names to refer to computational objects. We say that
the <i>variable</i> whose
<i>value</i> is the object.
</p>

<p>
In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with
<code>define</code>. Typing
</p>

<p>
<code>(define size 2)</code>
</p>

<p>
causes the interpreter to associate the value 2 with the name
<code>size</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> Once the name <code>size</code> has been
associated with the number 2, we can refer to the value 2 by name:
</p>

<p>
<code>size 2 (* 5 size) 10</code>
</p>

<p>
Here are further examples of the use of <code>define</code>:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define pi 3.14159) (define radius 10) (* pi (* radius radius)) 314.159 (define circumference (* 2 pi radius)) circumference 62.8318</code>
</p>

<p>
<code>Define</code> is our language's simplest means of abstraction,
for it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound
operations, such as the <code>circumference</code> computed above. In general,
computational objects may have very complex structures, and it would be
extremely inconvenient to have to remember and repeat their details each
time we want to use them. Indeed, complex programs are constructed by
building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity.
The interpreter makes this step-by-step program construction
particularly convenient because name-object associations can be created
incrementally in successive interactions. This feature encourages the
incremental development and testing of
programs and is largely responsible for the fact that a
Lisp program usually consists of a large number of relatively simple
procedures.
</p>

<p>
It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with
symbols and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must
maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs.
This memory is called the <i>environment</i> (more precisely the
<i>global environment</i>, since we will see later that a
computation may involve a number of different
environments).<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup>

<h4 id="org262feb1"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.3</span> Evaluating Combinations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-3">
<p>
One of our goals in this chapter is to
isolate issues about thinking procedurally. As a case in point, let us
consider that, in evaluating combinations, the interpreter is itself
following a procedure.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To evaluate a combination, do the following:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
1.  Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
</p>

<p>
2.  Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost
subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of
the other subexpressions (the operands).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about processes
in general. First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to
accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first
perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination. Thus,
the evaluation rule is <i>recursive</i> in nature; that is, it
includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule
itself.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Notice how succinctly the idea of recursion can be used to
express what, in the case of a deeply nested combination, would
otherwise be viewed as a rather complicated process. For example,
evaluating
</p>

<p>
<code>(* (+ 2 (* 4 6))    (+ 3 5 7))</code>
</p>

<p>
requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different
combinations. We can obtain a picture of this process by
representing the combination in the form of a
tree, as shown in figure <a href="#org287f531">1.1</a>. Each
combination is represented by a node with
branches corresponding to the operator and the operands of
the combination stemming from it. The terminal nodes (that
is, nodes with no branches stemming from them) represent either
operators or numbers. Viewing evaluation in terms of the tree, we can
imagine that the values of the operands percolate upward, starting from
the terminal nodes and then combining at higher and higher levels. In
general, we shall see that recursion is a very powerful technique for
dealing with hierarchical, treelike objects. In fact, the ``percolate
values upward'' form of the evaluation rule is an example of a general
kind of process known as <i>tree accumulation</i>.
</p>



<div id="org287f531" class="figure">

</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>Figure 1.1:</b>  Tree representation, showing the value of each
subcombination.
</p>

<p>
Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us
to the point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but primitive
expressions such as numerals, built-in operators, or other names. We
take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that
</p>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li>the values of numerals are the numbers that they name,</li>
<li>the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences
that carry out the corresponding operations, and</li>
<li>the values of other names are the objects associated with those names
in the environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We may regard the second rule as a special case of the third one by
stipulating that symbols such as <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are also included in the
global environment, and are associated with the sequences of machine
instructions that are their ``values.'' The key point to notice is the
role of the environment in determining the meaning of the
symbols in expressions. In an interactive language such as Lisp, it is
meaningless to speak of the value of an expression such as <code>(+ x 1)</code>
without specifying any information about the environment that would
provide a meaning for the symbol <code>x</code> (or even for the symbol <code>+</code>). As we
shall see in chapter 3, the general notion of the environment as
providing a context in which evaluation takes place will play an
important role in our understanding of program execution.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle
definitions. For instance, evaluating <code>(define x 3)</code> does not apply
<code>define</code> to two arguments, one of which is the value of the symbol <code>x</code>
and the other of which is 3, since the purpose of the <code>define</code> is
precisely to associate <code>x</code> with a value. (That is, <code>(define x 3)</code> is not
a combination.)
</p>

<p>
Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called
<i>special forms</i>. <code>Define</code> is the only example of a special form that we
have seen so far, but we will meet others shortly. Each
special form has its own evaluation rule. The various kinds of
expressions (each with its associated evaluation rule) constitute the
syntax of the programming language. In comparison with most
other programming languages, Lisp has a very simple syntax; that is, the
evaluation rule for expressions can be described by a simple general
rule together with specialized rules for a small number of special
forms.<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup>

<div id="outline-container-org28d8f35" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org28d8f35"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.4</span> Compound Procedures</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-4">
<p>
We have identified in Lisp some of the elements that must appear in any
powerful programming language:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive data and procedures.</li>
<li>Nesting of combinations provides a means of combining operations.</li>
<li>Definitions that associate names with values provide a limited means
of abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now we will learn about <i>procedure definitions</i>, a much
more powerful abstraction technique by which a compound operation can be
given a name and then referred to as a unit.
</p>

<p>
We begin by examining how to express the idea of ``squaring.'' We might
say, ``To square something, multiply it by itself.'' This is expressed
in our language as
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (square x) (* x x))</code>
</p>

<p>
We can understand this in the following way:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (square  x)        (*         x     x))                                          To      square something, multiply   it by itself.</code>
</p>

<p>
We have here a <i>compound procedure</i>, which has
been given the name <code>square</code>. The procedure represents the operation of
multiplying something by itself. The thing to be multiplied is given a
local name, <code>x</code>, which plays the same role that a pronoun plays in
natural language. Evaluating the
definition creates this compound procedure and associates it with the
name <code>square</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The general form of a procedure definition is
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (&lt;name&gt; &lt;formal parameters&gt;) &lt;body&gt;)</code>
</p>

<p>
The &lt;/name/&gt; is a symbol to be associated with
the procedure definition in the environment.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup>
The &lt;/formal parameters/&gt; are the names used
within the body of the procedure to refer to the corresponding arguments
of the procedure. The &lt;/body/&gt; is an
expression that will yield the value of the procedure application when
the formal parameters are replaced by the actual arguments to which the
procedure is applied.<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup> The &lt;/name/&gt; and the
&lt;/formal parameters/&gt; are grouped within parentheses, just
as they would be in an actual call to the procedure being defined.
</p>

<p>
Having defined <code>square</code>, we can now use it:
</p>

<p>
<code>(square 21) 441  (square (+ 2 5)) 49  (square (square 3)) 81</code>
</p>

<p>
We can also use <code>square</code> as a building block in defining other
procedures. For example, /x/<sup>2</sup> + /y/<sup>2</sup> can be expressed as
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ (square x) (square y))</code>
</p>

<p>
We can easily define a procedure <code>sum-of-squares</code> that, given any two
numbers as arguments, produces the sum of their squares:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (sum-of-squares x y)   (+ (square x) (square y)))  (sum-of-squares 3 4) 25</code>
</p>

<p>
Now we can use <code>sum-of-squares</code> as a building block in constructing
further procedures:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (f a)   (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))  (f 5) 136</code>
</p>

<p>
Compound procedures are used in exactly the same way as
primitive procedures. Indeed, one could not tell by looking at the
definition of <code>sum-of-squares</code> given above whether <code>square</code> was built
into the interpreter, like <code>+</code> and <code>*</code>, or defined as a compound
procedure.

<div id="outline-container-orgc0baf68" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc0baf68"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.5</span> The Substitution Model for Procedure Application</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-5">
<p>
 To evaluate a combination whose operator names a compound
procedure, the interpreter follows much the same process as for
combinations whose operators name primitive procedures, which we
described in section <a href="#org262feb1">1.1.3</a>. That is, the interpreter
evaluates the elements of the combination and applies the procedure
(which is the value of the operator of the combination) to the arguments
(which are the values of the operands of the combination).
</p>

<p>
We can assume that the mechanism for applying primitive procedures to
arguments is built into the interpreter. For compound procedures, the
application process is as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the
procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding
argument.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To illustrate this process, let's evaluate the combination
</p>

<p>
<code>(f 5)</code>
</p>

<p>
where <code>f</code> is the procedure defined in section <a href="#org28d8f35">1.1.4</a>.
We begin by retrieving the body of <code>f</code>:
</p>

<p>
<code>(sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2))</code>
</p>

<p>
Then we replace the formal parameter <code>a</code> by the argument 5:
</p>

<p>
<code>(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))</code>
</p>

<p>
Thus the problem reduces to the evaluation of a combination with two
operands and an operator <code>sum-of-squares</code>. Evaluating this combination
involves three subproblems. We must evaluate the operator to get the
procedure to be applied, and we must evaluate the operands to get the
arguments. Now <code>(+ 5 1)</code> produces 6 and <code>(* 5 2)</code> produces 10, so we
must apply the <code>sum-of-squares</code> procedure to 6 and 10. These values are
substituted for the formal parameters <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the body of
<code>sum-of-squares</code>, reducing the expression to
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ (square 6) (square 10))</code>
</p>

<p>
If we use the definition of <code>square</code>, this reduces to
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))</code>
</p>

<p>
which reduces by multiplication to
</p>

<p>
<code>(+ 36 100)</code>
</p>

<p>
and finally to
</p>

<p>
<code>136</code>
</p>

<p>
The process we have just described is called the <i>substitution model</i>
for procedure application. It can be taken as a model that determines
the ``meaning'' of procedure application, insofar as the procedures in
this chapter are concerned. However, there are two points that should be
stressed:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The purpose of the substitution is to help us think about procedure
application, not to provide a description of how the interpreter
really works. Typical interpreters do not evaluate procedure
applications by manipulating the text of a procedure to substitute
values for the formal parameters. In practice, the ``substitution'' is
accomplished by using a local environment for the formal parameters.
We will discuss this more fully in chapters 3 and 4 when we examine
the implementation of an interpreter in detail.</li>
<li>Over the course of this book, we will present a sequence of
increasingly elaborate models of how interpreters work, culminating
with a complete implementation of an interpreter and compiler in
chapter 5. The substitution model is only the first of these models &#x2013;
a way to get started thinking formally about the evaluation process.
In general, when modeling phenomena in science and
engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete models. As we
examine things in greater detail, these simple models become
inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models. The
substitution model is no exception. In particular, when we address in
chapter 3 the use of procedures with ``mutable data,'' we will see
that the substitution model breaks down and must be replaced by a more
complicated model of procedure
application.<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup></li>
</ul>
</div>



<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org39daeb5"></a>Applicative order versus normal order<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-1-5-1">
<p>
According to the description of evaluation given in
section <a href="#org262feb1">1.1.3</a>, the interpreter first evaluates the
operator and operands and then applies the resulting procedure to the
resulting arguments. This is not the only way to perform evaluation. An
alternative evaluation model would not evaluate the operands until their
values were needed. Instead it would first substitute operand
expressions for parameters until it obtained an expression involving
only primitive operators, and would then perform the evaluation. If we
used this method, the evaluation of
</p>

<p>
<code>(f 5)</code>
</p>

<p>
would proceed according to the sequence of expansions
</p>

<p>
<code>(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))  (+    (square (+ 5 1))      (square (* 5 2))  )  (+    (* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1))   (* (* 5 2) (* 5 2)))</code>
</p>

<p>
followed by the reductions
</p>

<p>
<code>(+         (* 6 6)             (* 10 10))  (+           36                   100)                      136</code>
</p>

<p>
This gives the same answer as our previous evaluation model, but the
process is different. In particular, the evaluations of <code>(+ 5 1)</code> and
<code>(* 5 2)</code> are each performed twice here, corresponding to the reduction
of the expression
</p>

<p>
<code>(* x x)</code>
</p>

<p>
with <code>x</code> replaced respectively by <code>(+ 5 1)</code> and <code>(* 5 2)</code>.
</p>

<p>
This alternative ``fully expand and then reduce'' evaluation method is
known as <i>normal-order evaluation</i>, in contrast to the
``evaluate the arguments and then apply'' method that the interpreter
actually uses, which is called <i>applicative-order
evaluation</i>. It can be shown that, for procedure applications that can
be modeled using substitution (including all the procedures in the first
two chapters of this book) and that yield legitimate values,
normal-order and applicative-order evaluation produce the same value.
(See exercise <a href="#org829a5b7">1.5</a> for an instance of an ``illegitimate''
value where normal-order and applicative-order evaluation do not give
the same result.)
</p>

<p>
Lisp uses applicative-order evaluation, partly
because of the additional efficiency obtained from avoiding multiple
evaluations of expressions such as those illustrated with <code>(+ 5 1)</code> and
<code>(* 5 2)</code> above and, more significantly, because normal-order evaluation
becomes much more complicated to deal with when we leave the realm of
procedures that can be modeled by substitution. On the other hand,
normal-order evaluation can be an extremely valuable tool, and we will
investigate some of its implications in chapters 3 and
4.<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-6">
<p>
The expressive power of the class of procedures that we can define at
this point is very limited, because we have no way to make tests and to
perform different operations depending on the result of a test. For
instance, we cannot define a procedure that computes the
absolute value of a number by testing whether the number is
positive, negative, or zero and taking different actions in the
different cases according to the rule

<p>
This construct is called a <i>case analysis</i>, and there is a
special form in Lisp for notating such a case analysis. It is called
<code>cond</code> (which stands for
``conditional''), and it is used as follows:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (abs x)   (cond ((&gt; x 0) x)         ((</code> x 0) 0)         ((&lt; x 0) (- x))))=
</p>

<p>
The general form of a conditional expression is
</p>

<p>
<code>(cond (&lt;p1&gt; &lt;e1&gt;)       (&lt;p2&gt; &lt;e2&gt;)              (&lt;pn&gt; &lt;en&gt;))</code>
</p>

<p>
consisting of the symbol <code>cond</code> followed by parenthesized
pairs of expressions <code>(&lt;p&gt; &lt;e&gt;)</code> called
<i>clauses</i>. The first expression in each pair
is a <i>predicate</i> &#x2013; that is, an expression whose value is
interpreted as either true or false.<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17">17</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Conditional expressions are evaluated as
follows. The predicate &lt;/p<sub>1</sub>/&gt; is evaluated first. If its value is
false, then &lt;/p<sub>2</sub>/&gt; is evaluated. If &lt;/p<sub>2</sub>/&gt;'s value is also false,
then &lt;/p<sub>3</sub>/&gt; is evaluated. This process continues until a predicate is
found whose value is true, in which case the interpreter returns the
value of the corresponding <i>consequent expression</i> &lt;/e/&gt; of
the clause as the value of the conditional expression. If none of the
&lt;/p/&gt;'s is found to be true, the value of the <code>cond</code> is undefined.
</p>

<p>
The word <i>predicate</i> is used for procedures that return
true or false, as well as for expressions that evaluate to true or
false. The absolute-value procedure <code>abs</code> makes use of the
primitive
predicates <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and <code>=</code>.<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18">18</a></sup> These take two
numbers as arguments and test whether the first number is, respectively,
greater than, less than, or equal to the second number, returning true
or false accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Another way to write the absolute-value procedure is
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (abs x)   (cond ((&lt; x 0) (- x))         (else x)))</code>
</p>

<p>
which could be expressed in English as ``If <i>x</i> is less than zero
return - <i>x</i>; otherwise return <i>x</i>.'' <code>Else</code> is a special
symbol that can be used in place of the &lt;/p/&gt; in the final clause of a
<code>cond</code>. This causes the <code>cond</code> to return as its value the value of the
corresponding &lt;/e/&gt; whenever all previous clauses have been bypassed. In
fact, any expression that always evaluates to a true value could be used
as the &lt;/p/&gt; here.
</p>

<p>
Here is yet another way to write the absolute-value procedure:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (abs x)   (if (&lt; x 0)       (- x)       x))</code>
</p>

<p>
This uses the special form <code>if</code>,
a restricted type of conditional that can be used when there are
precisely two cases in the case analysis. The general form
of an <code>if</code> expression is
</p>

<p>
<code>(if &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;consequent&gt; &lt;alternative&gt;)</code>
</p>

<p>
To evaluate an <code>if</code> expression,
the interpreter starts by evaluating the &lt;/predicate/&gt; part
of the expression. If the &lt;/predicate/&gt; evaluates to a true value, the
interpreter then evaluates the &lt;/consequent/&gt; and returns
its value. Otherwise it evaluates the &lt;/alternative/&gt; and
returns its value.<sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19">19</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In addition to primitive predicates such as <code>&lt;</code>, <code>=</code>, and <code>&gt;</code>, there are
logical composition operations, which enable us to construct compound
predicates. The three most frequently used are these:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<code>(and &lt;e1&gt; ...</code> &lt;/e<sub><i>n</i></sub>/&gt;)
</p>

<p>
The interpreter evaluates the expressions &lt;/e/&gt; one at a time, in
left-to-right order. If any &lt;/e/&gt; evaluates to false, the value of the
<code>and</code> expression is false, and the rest of the &lt;/e/&gt;'s are not
evaluated. If all &lt;/e/&gt;'s evaluate to true values, the value of the
<code>and</code> expression is the value of the last one.
</p></li>
</ul>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<code>(or &lt;e1&gt; ...</code> &lt;/e<sub><i>n</i></sub>/&gt;)
</p>

<p>
The interpreter evaluates the expressions &lt;/e/&gt; one at a time, in
left-to-right order. If any &lt;/e/&gt; evaluates to a true value, that
value is returned as the value of the <code>or</code> expression, and the rest of
the &lt;/e/&gt;'s are not evaluated. If all &lt;/e/&gt;'s evaluate to false, the
value of the <code>or</code> expression is false.
</p></li>
</ul>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<code>(not &lt;e&gt;)</code>
</p>

<p>
The value of a <code>not</code> expression is true when the expression &lt;/e/&gt;
evaluates to false, and false otherwise.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Notice that <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> are special forms,
not procedures, because the subexpressions are not necessarily all
evaluated. <code>Not</code> is an ordinary procedure.
</p>

<p>
As an example of how these are used, the condition that a number <i>x</i> be
in the range 5 &lt; <i>x</i> &lt; 10 may be expressed as
</p>

<p>
<code>(and (&gt; x 5) (&lt; x 10))</code>
</p>

<p>
As another example, we can define a predicate to test whether one number
is greater than or equal to another as
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (&gt;</code> x y)   (or (&gt; x y) (= x y)))=

with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation.
He defines the following two procedures:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (p) (p))  (define (test x y)   (if (</code> x 0)       0       y))=
</p>

<p>
Then he evaluates the expression
</p>

<p>
<code>(test 0 (p))</code>
</p>

<p>
What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses
applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an
interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer.
(Assume that the evaluation rule for the
special form <code>if</code> is the same whether the interpreter is using normal or
applicative order: The predicate expression is evaluated first, and the
result determines whether to evaluate the consequent or the alternative
expression.)

Procedures, as introduced above, are much like
ordinary mathematical functions. They specify a value that is determined
by one or more parameters. But there is an important difference between
mathematical functions and computer procedures. Procedures must be
effective.
</p>

<p>
As a case in point, consider the problem of computing square roots. We
can define the square-root function as

<p>
This describes a perfectly legitimate mathematical function. We could
use it to recognize whether one number is the square root of another, or
to derive facts about square roots in general. On the other hand, the
definition does not describe a procedure. Indeed, it tells us almost
nothing about how to actually find the square root of a given number. It
will not help matters to rephrase this definition in pseudo-Lisp:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (sqrt x)   (the y (and (&gt;</code> y 0)               (= (square y) x))))=
</p>

<p>
This only begs the question.
</p>

<p>
The contrast between function and procedure is a reflection of the
general distinction between describing properties of things and
describing how to do things, or, as it is sometimes referred to, the
distinction between declarative knowledge and
imperative knowledge. In mathematics we are
usually concerned with declarative (what is) descriptions, whereas in
computer science we are usually concerned with imperative (how to)
descriptions.<sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20">20</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
How does one compute square roots? The most
common way is to use Newton's method of successive approximations, which
says that whenever we have a guess <i>y</i> for the value of the square root
of a number <i>x</i>, we can perform a simple manipulation to get a better
guess (one closer to the actual square root) by averaging <i>y</i> with
<i>x///y</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21">21</a></sup> For example, we can compute the
square root of 2 as follows. Suppose our initial guess is 1:

<p>
Continuing this process, we obtain better and better approximations to
the square root.
</p>

<p>
Now let's formalize the process in terms of procedures. We start with a
value for the radicand (the number whose square root we are
trying to compute) and a value for the guess. If the guess is good
enough for our purposes, we are done; if not, we must repeat the process
with an improved guess. We write this basic strategy as a procedure:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (sqrt-iter guess x)   (if (good-enough? guess x)       guess       (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)                  x)))</code>
</p>

<p>
A guess is improved by averaging it with the quotient of the radicand
and the old guess:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (improve guess x)   (average guess (/ x guess)))</code>
</p>

<p>
where
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (average x y)   (/ (+ x y) 2))</code>
</p>

<p>
We also have to say what we mean by ``good enough.'' The following will
do for illustration, but it is not really a very good test. (See
exercise .) The idea is to improve the answer until
it is close enough so that its square differs from the radicand by less
than a predetermined tolerance (here 0.001):<sup><a id="fnr.22" class="footref" href="#fn.22">22</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (good-enough? guess x)   (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))</code>
</p>

<p>
Finally, we need a way to get started. For instance, we can always guess
that the square root of any number is 1:<sup><a id="fnr.23" class="footref" href="#fn.23">23</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (sqrt x)   (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))</code>
</p>

<p>
If we type these definitions to the interpreter, we can use <code>sqrt</code> just
as we can use any procedure:
</p>

<p>
<code>(sqrt 9) 3.00009155413138 (sqrt (+ 100 37)) 11.704699917758145 (sqrt (+ (sqrt 2) (sqrt 3))) 1.7739279023207892 (square (sqrt 1000)) 1000.000369924366</code>
</p>

<p>
The <code>sqrt</code> program also illustrates that the simple
procedural language we have introduced so far is sufficient for writing
any purely numerical program that one could write in, say, C or Pascal.
This might seem surprising, since we have not included in our language
any iterative (looping) constructs that direct the computer
to do something over and over again. <code>Sqrt-iter</code>, on the other hand,
demonstrates how iteration can be accomplished using no special
construct other than the ordinary ability to call a
procedure.<sup><a id="fnr.24" class="footref" href="#fn.24">24</a></sup>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-8">
<p>
<code>Sqrt</code> is our first example of a process defined by a set of mutually
defined procedures. Notice that the definition of <code>sqrt-iter</code> is
<i>recursive</i>; that is, the procedure is defined in terms of
itself. The idea of being able to define a procedure in terms of itself
may be disturbing; it may seem unclear how such a ``circular''
definition could make sense at all, much less specify a well-defined
process to be carried out by a computer. This will be addressed more
carefully in section . But first
let's consider some other important points illustrated by the <code>sqrt</code>
example.
</p>

<p>
Observe that the problem of computing square roots breaks
up naturally into a number of subproblems: how to tell whether a guess
is good enough, how to improve a guess, and so on. Each of these tasks
is accomplished by a separate procedure. The entire <code>sqrt</code> program can
be viewed as a cluster of procedures (shown in
figure <a href="#org2aecea4">1.2</a>) that mirrors the decomposition of the
problem into subproblems.
</p>



<div id="org2aecea4" class="figure">
<p><img src="ch1-Z-G-6.gif" alt="ch1-Z-G-6.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>Figure 1.2:</b>  Procedural decomposition of the <code>sqrt</code> program.
</p>

<p>
The importance of this decomposition strategy is not simply
that one is dividing the program into parts. After all, we could take
any large program and divide it into parts &#x2013; the first ten lines, the
next ten lines, the next ten lines, and so on. Rather, it is crucial
that each procedure accomplishes an identifiable task that can be used
as a module in defining other procedures. For example, when
we define the <code>good-enough?</code> procedure in terms of <code>square</code>, we are able
to regard the <code>square</code> procedure as a ``black box.'' We are
not at that moment concerned with <i>how</i> the procedure computes its
result, only with the fact that it computes the square. The details of
how the square is computed can be suppressed, to be considered at a
later time. Indeed, as far as the <code>good-enough?</code> procedure is concerned,
<code>square</code> is not quite a procedure but rather an abstraction of a
procedure, a so-called <i>procedural
abstraction</i>. At this level of abstraction, any procedure that computes
the square is equally good.
</p>

<p>
Thus, considering only the values they return, the following two
procedures for squaring a number should be indistinguishable. Each takes
a numerical argument and produces the square of that number as the
value.<sup><a id="fnr.25" class="footref" href="#fn.25">25</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (square x) (* x x))  (define (square x)    (exp (double (log x))))  (define (double x) (+ x x))</code>
</p>

<p>
So a procedure definition should be able to suppress detail. The users
of the procedure may not have written the procedure themselves, but may
have obtained it from another programmer as a black box. A user should
not need to know how the procedure is implemented in order to use it.
</p>
</div>



<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org19bf2dc"></a>Local names<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-1-8-1">
<p>
One detail of a procedure's implementation that should not
matter to the user of the procedure is the implementer's choice of names
for the procedure's formal parameters. Thus, the following procedures
should not be distinguishable:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (square x) (* x x))  (define (square y) (* y y))</code>
</p>

<p>
This principle &#x2013; that the meaning of a procedure should be independent
of the parameter names used by its author &#x2013; seems on the surface to be
self-evident, but its consequences are profound. The simplest
consequence is that the parameter names of a procedure must be local to
the body of the procedure. For example, we used <code>square</code> in the
definition of <code>good-enough?</code> in our square-root procedure:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (good-enough? guess x)   (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))</code>
</p>

<p>
The intention of the author of <code>good-enough?</code> is to determine if the
square of the first argument is within a given tolerance of the second
argument. We see that the author of <code>good-enough?</code> used the name <code>guess</code>
to refer to the first argument and <code>x</code> to refer to the second argument.
The argument of <code>square</code> is <code>guess</code>. If the author of <code>square</code> used <code>x</code>
(as above) to refer to that argument, we see that the <code>x</code> in
<code>good-enough?</code> must be a different <code>x</code> than the one in <code>square</code>. Running
the procedure <code>square</code> must not affect the value of <code>x</code> that is used by
<code>good-enough?</code>, because that value of <code>x</code> may be needed by
<code>good-enough?</code> after <code>square</code> is done computing.
</p>

<p>
If the parameters were not local to the bodies of their respective
procedures, then the parameter <code>x</code> in <code>square</code> could be confused with
the parameter <code>x</code> in <code>good-enough?</code>, and the behavior of <code>good-enough?</code>
would depend upon which version of <code>square</code> we used. Thus, <code>square</code>
would not be the black box we desired.
</p>

<p>
A formal parameter of a procedure has a very
special role in the procedure definition, in that it doesn't matter what
name the formal parameter has. Such a name is called a
<i>bound variable</i>, and we say that the
procedure definition <i>binds</i> its formal parameters. The
meaning of a procedure definition is unchanged if a bound variable is
consistently renamed throughout the
definition.<sup><a id="fnr.26" class="footref" href="#fn.26">26</a></sup> If a variable is not bound, we
say that it is <i>free</i>. The set of expressions
for which a binding defines a name is called the
<i>scope</i> of that name. In a procedure
definition, the bound variables declared as the
formal parameters of the
procedure have the body of the procedure as their scope.
</p>

<p>
In the definition of <code>good-enough?</code> above, <code>guess</code> and <code>x</code> are bound
variables but <code>&lt;</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>abs</code>, and <code>square</code> are free. The meaning of
<code>good-enough?</code> should be independent of the names we choose for <code>guess</code>
and <code>x</code> so long as they are distinct and different from <code>&lt;</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>abs</code>,
and <code>square</code>. (If we renamed <code>guess</code> to <code>abs</code> we would have introduced a
bug by <i>capturing</i> the variable
<code>abs</code>. It would have changed from free to bound.) The meaning of
<code>good-enough?</code> is not independent of the names of its free variables,
however. It surely depends upon the fact (external to this definition)
that the symbol <code>abs</code> names a procedure for computing the absolute value
of a number. <code>Good-enough?</code> will compute a different function if we
substitute <code>cos</code> for <code>abs</code> in its definition.
</p>
</div>
</li>



<li><a id="orgc242a1e"></a>Internal definitions and block structure<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-1-8-2">
<p>
We have one kind of name isolation available to us so far: The formal
parameters of a procedure are local to the body of the procedure. The
square-root program illustrates another way in which we would like to
control the use of names. The existing program consists of
separate procedures:
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (sqrt x)   (sqrt-iter 1.0 x)) (define (sqrt-iter guess x)   (if (good-enough? guess x)       guess       (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x))) (define (good-enough? guess x)   (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001)) (define (improve guess x)   (average guess (/ x guess)))</code>
</p>

<p>
The problem with this program is that the only procedure that is
important to users of <code>sqrt</code> is <code>sqrt</code>. The other procedures
(<code>sqrt-iter</code>, <code>good-enough?</code>, and <code>improve</code>) only clutter up their
minds. They may not define any other procedure called <code>good-enough?</code> as
part of another program to work together with the square-root program,
because <code>sqrt</code> needs it. The problem is especially severe in the
construction of large systems by many separate programmers. For example,
in the construction of a large library of numerical procedures, many
numerical functions are computed as successive approximations and thus
might have procedures named <code>good-enough?</code> and <code>improve</code> as auxiliary
procedures. We would like to localize the subprocedures, hiding them
inside <code>sqrt</code> so that <code>sqrt</code> could coexist with other successive
approximations, each having its own private <code>good-enough?</code> procedure. To
make this possible, we allow a procedure to have
internal definitions that are local to that
procedure. For example, in the square-root problem we can write
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (sqrt x)   (define (good-enough? guess x)     (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))   (define (improve guess x)     (average guess (/ x guess)))   (define (sqrt-iter guess x)     (if (good-enough? guess x)         guess         (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))   (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))</code>
</p>

<p>
Such nesting of definitions, called <i>block structure</i>, is basically the
right solution to the simplest name-packaging problem. But there is a
better idea lurking here. In addition to internalizing the definitions
of the auxiliary procedures, we can simplify them. Since <code>x</code> is bound in
the definition of <code>sqrt</code>, the procedures <code>good-enough?</code>, <code>improve</code>, and
<code>sqrt-iter</code>, which are defined internally to <code>sqrt</code>, are in the scope of
<code>x</code>. Thus, it is not necessary to pass <code>x</code> explicitly to each of these
procedures. Instead, we allow <code>x</code> to be a free
variable in the internal definitions, as shown below. Then <code>x</code> gets its
value from the argument with which the enclosing procedure <code>sqrt</code> is
called. This discipline is called <i>lexical
scoping</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.27" class="footref" href="#fn.27">27</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<code>(define (sqrt x)   (define (good-enough? guess)     (&lt; (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))   (define (improve guess)     (average guess (/ x guess)))   (define (sqrt-iter guess)     (if (good-enough? guess)         guess         (sqrt-iter (improve guess))))   (sqrt-iter 1.0))</code>
</p>

<p>
We will use block structure extensively to help us break up large
programs into tractable pieces.<sup><a id="fnr.28" class="footref" href="#fn.28">28</a></sup> The idea of
block structure originated with the programming language
Algol 60. It appears in most advanced programming languages
and is an important tool for helping to organize the construction of
large programs.

source of the quip by Alan Perlis (paraphrasing Oscar Wilde) that ``Lisp
programmers know the value of everything but the cost of nothing.''

It may seem strange that the
evaluation rule says, as part of the first step, that we should evaluate
the leftmost element of a combination, since at this point that can only
be an operator such as <code>+</code> or <code>*</code> representing a built-in primitive
procedure such as addition or multiplication. We will see later that it
is useful to be able to work with combinations whose operators are
themselves compound expressions.

Special
syntactic forms that are simply convenient alternative surface
structures for things that can be written in more uniform ways are
sometimes called <i>syntactic sugar</i>, to use a phrase coined by Peter
Landin. In comparison with users of other languages, Lisp programmers,
as a rule, are less concerned with matters of syntax. (By contrast,
examine any Pascal manual and notice how much of it is devoted to
descriptions of syntax.) This disdain for syntax is due partly to the
flexibility of Lisp, which makes it easy to change surface syntax, and
partly to the observation that many ``convenient'' syntactic constructs,
which make the language less uniform, end up causing more trouble than
they are worth when programs become large and complex. In the words of
Alan Perlis, ``Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.''

Despite the simplicity of the
substitution idea, it turns out to be surprisingly complicated to give a
rigorous mathematical definition of the substitution process. The
problem arises from the possibility of confusion between the names used
for the formal parameters of a procedure and the (possibly identical)
names used in the expressions to which the procedure may be applied.
Indeed, there is a long history of erroneous definitions of
<i>substitution</i> in the literature of logic and programming semantics.
See Stoy 1977 for a careful discussion of substitution.

``Interpreted
as either true or false'' means this: In Scheme, there are two
distinguished values that are denoted by the constants <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>.
When the interpreter checks a predicate's value, it interprets <code>#f</code> as
false. Any other value is treated as true. (Thus, providing <code>#t</code> is
logically unnecessary, but it is convenient.) In this book we will use
names <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, which are associated with the values <code>#t</code> and

Declarative and imperative
descriptions are intimately related, as indeed are mathematics and
computer science. For instance, to say that the answer produced by a
program is ``correct'' is to make a declarative statement
about the program. There is a large amount of research aimed at
establishing techniques for proving that programs are
correct, and much of the technical difficulty of this subject has to do
with negotiating the transition between imperative statements (from
which programs are constructed) and declarative statements (which can be
used to deduce things). In a related vein, an important current area in
programming-language design is the exploration of so-called
very high-level languages, in which one
actually programs in terms of declarative statements. The idea is to
make interpreters sophisticated enough so that, given ``what is''
knowledge specified by the programmer, they can generate ``how to''
knowledge automatically. This cannot be done in general, but there are
important areas where progress has been made. We shall revisit this idea
in chapter 4.

Observe that we express our initial

Lisp implementations.
MIT
Scheme, however, distinguishes between exact integers and decimal
values, and dividing two integers produces a rational number rather than
a decimal. For example, dividing 10 by 6 yields 5/3, while dividing 10.0
by 6.0 yields 1.6666666666666667. (We will learn how to implement
arithmetic on rational numbers in
section .) If we start with
an initial guess of 1 in our square-root program, and <i>x</i> is an exact
integer, all subsequent values produced in the square-root computation
will be rational numbers rather than decimals. Mixed operations on
rational numbers and decimals always yield decimals, so starting with an
initial guess of 1.0 forces all subsequent values to be decimals.
